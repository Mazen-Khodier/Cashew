# Cashew
Python Implementation of Dana Angluin's Algorithm from "Learning Regular Sets from Queries and Counterexamples" Using Walnut to construct self verifying predicates

## Todo
- Allow resuming runs
- customize predicate name(s)
- temp variable at beginning is BASE
- Assume membership is false if found always?
- organize table (S first, lexicographic order)
- optimize consistency and closed tests
- split modules
- Multi-layered membership approach

## Membership Options
- always instantiated predicate
- generate word itself
- generate automaton then instantiate
- last but with reg exp
- last in multiple steps (lhs, rhs)
